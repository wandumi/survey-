How to Use:

Clone the files

After clonning run npm install and edit the env.files to your database

Run php artisan migrate

and run php artisan db:seed 

The following users will be seeded 

Administrator:
Username: admin@admin.com
Password: admin123

User
Username: user@admin.com
Password: admin123

Then you can login to administrator and create a survey and questions that will belong to the survey created.

The user will be able to view the survey after they have been created, a user can take a survey only once.


The user can be the survey taker and the administrator can be a user who has administrator prevaledges.

I was having a scenario where the user is someone who takes the survey and administrator being users that have administrator prevaledges
